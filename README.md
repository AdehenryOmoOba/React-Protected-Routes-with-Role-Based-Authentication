This project is the frontend component of a MERN stack application.
This project implements username and password protected routes using "react-router-dom", "context" api and "useState" hook.
In addition to implementing protected routes, this project also implemented user-level/role-based authentication, meaning diferent users
have different level of authorisation access, while some users have access to all the routes, other users only have access to some of the routes
mimicking organisational hierarchy authorisation levels.
The backend component will be uploaded seperately.
